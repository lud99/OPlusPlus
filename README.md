# Ö++

This is the repository for my research paper/project where I compared different execution methods for executing source code. 
To do this I made my own programming language and compiler that targeted Assembly, a Bytecode Virtual Machine and an AST Interpreter.

Please read the research paper for more details (in Swedish), [Metoder för exekvering av programkod och dess effektivitet - Gymnasiearbete Ludvig Magnusson 2023.pdf](https://github.com/lud99/OPlusPlus/blob/master/Metoder%20f%C3%B6r%20exekvering%20av%20programkod%20och%20dess%20effektivitet%20-%20Gymnasiearbete%20Ludvig%20Magnusson%202023.pdf)

# New version
I have continued improving the compiler with a much more robust parser, a seperate and much better semantic analysis step, along with more a more flexible type system and classes.
The code for that is under development and in the [rework-parsing](https://github.com/lud99/OPlusPlus/tree/rework-parsing) branch.

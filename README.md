# Ã–++

This is the repository for my research paper/project where I compared different execution methods for executing source code. 
To do this I made my own programming language and compiler that targeted Assembly, a Bytecode Virtual Machine and an AST Interpreter.

Please read the research paper for more details (in Swedish) https://github.com/lud99/OPlusPlus/blob/master/Gymnasiearbete.pdf
